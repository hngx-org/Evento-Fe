# Evento Apprenticeship Frontend

This is a `Nextjs, Typescript and Tailwindcss` project.

## Getting Starte

This project uses `npm workspaces` as default monorepo architecture.

### First clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hngx-org/evento-fe.git
```

#### Install all dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

#### Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

## Types

As you know by now that this is a typescript based project. Please all types must be created separately in the `type` or `@types` directly outside of the components folder. If your components require a custom type, create them inside a folder called `types` or `@types` and export it to be used somewhere else.

## Commit Standards

## Branches

- **dev** -> pr this branch for everything `frontend` related
- **main** -> **dont touch** this branch, this is what is running in production.

## Contributions

Evento is open to contributions, but I recommend creating an issue or replying in a comment to let us know what you are working on first that way we don't overwrite each other.

## Contribution Guidelines

1. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/hngx-org/evento-fe.git`.
2. Open your terminal & set the origin branch: `git remote add origin https://github.com/hngx-org/evento-fe.git`
3. Pull origin `git pull origin dev`
4. Create a new branch for the task you were assigned to, eg `TicketNumber/(Feat/Bug/Fix/Chore)/Ticket-title` : `git checkout -b ZA-001/Feat/Sign-Up-from`
5. After making changes, do `git add .`
6. Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message : `git commit -m "your commit message"`.
7. To make sure there are no conflicts, run `git pull origin dev`.
8. Push changes to your new branch, run `git push -u origin ZA-001/Feat/Sign-Up-from`.
9. Create a pull request to the `dev` branch not `main`.
10. Ensure to describe your pull request.
11. > If you've added code that should be tested, add some test examples.

## Merging

Under any circumstances should you merge a pull requests on a specific branch to the `dev` or `main` branch

> _Sample Commit Messages_

- `chore: Updated README file` := `chore` is used because the commit didn't make any changes to the , frontend or test folders in any way.
- `feat: Added plugin info endpoints` := `feat` is used here because the feature was non-existent before the commit.

## Code Explanation

### API Calls

A separate folder called `http` which contains `axios.ts` and `index.ts` files where created to handle any outgoing or incoming http request/response. the `index.ts` file should contain all outgoing `API` calls to the backend server.

> ❗❗Do not create any custom http calls inside a page or components. Whatever calls that need to be processed by the server should be called within the `index.ts` file.

### Custom Authentication Handler

Within the `helpers` folder contains **two** different files called `withAuth.tsx` and `withoutAuth.tsx`.

- **WithAuth.tsx** :- is a `HOF` function which wraps every components that needs protection or protected route components. for eg `Dashboard` or any other page that require the user to be loggedIn. All you have to do is import the custom handler and wrap your component inside it. i.e

```js
withAuth(Dashboard);
withAuth(Promotion);
```

- **WithoutAuth.tsx** :- is the opposite of `withAuth.tsx` HOF. It only meant to be used to prevent loggedIn users from redirecting or navigating to a page. i.e when a user is loggedIn and you dont want them to view a certain page, use this function.

```js
withoutAuth(Login);
withoutAuth(Signup);
```
